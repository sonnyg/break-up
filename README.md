# break-up

Break-up is the second project for code-club (a small activity I do with my children to teach them coding).

This project is designed to build on the foundations established in [lift-off](https://github.com/sonnyg/lift-off)
by adding basic collision detection, user input and sounds.

It was inspired by the [canvas-workshop tutorial](https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop) from enclave

I typically write the exercises here to organize myself, then do paired programming with my children.

I am also learning Javascript (and teaching!) alongside my children. My plan is to use tags on the branch to coincide with specific lessons.
